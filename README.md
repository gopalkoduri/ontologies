As part of CompMusic project (http://compmusic.upf.edu), there are a number of ontologies developed for describing the the musical concepts and relationships in Indian art music (raaga, taala, forms, artist relations...) and Ottoman-Turkish makam music (makam, usul, forms, music scores...). This repository hosts them all.

Please feel free to get in touch if you see some room for advancement/correction.
